Sales data visualization report introduction This report provides an overview of  sales data for  fiscal year 2023 using various views in Power BI. The data includes sales revenue, product categories, regional sales, and monthly trends. Each chart and visualization is carefully selected to show specific insights from your sales data. 

1. Sales revenue by product category Chart type: Bar chart explain: The bar chart shows the total sales revenue for each product category. This view allows you to compare the performance of different types of products at a glance. For example,  "Electronics" is found to have the highest sales volume, followed by "Household Appliances" and "Furniture". This insight helps determine which product lines are  most profitable and  need more attention or marketing efforts. 

2. Monthly sales conditions Chart type: Line chart explain:

 This line chart shows sales trends for the 12 months to 2023. These charts are useful for identifying seasonal patterns, trends and trades. For example, sales increase significantly in  November and December, possibly due to holiday shopping.


 3. Regional sales distribution Chart Type: Map Display explain: The chart shows the distribution of sales in different regions. Each area is color coded based on  total sales amount, with darker colors indicating higher sales. This map helps identify geographic areas with strong sales  and  growth. For example, sales volumes are higher in the East and West regions, while there is still room for improvement in the Midwest region.

 4. Consumer purchases Chart type: Bar chart explain: The bar chart shows the amount of sales made by each customer. This view helps to evaluate the performance of each member of the sales team. This report clearly identifies top performers and those in need of additional support or training. For example, "John Doe" and "Jane Smith" are the main salespeople who contribute significantly to all sales. 

5. Product performance on time Chart type: Stacked area chart explain: Stack area charts show the sales performance of various types of products over time. Each location represents a product category, and the total height of the selected locations represents cumulative sales. This chart provides an overview of  each category's contribution to  overall sales trends. The report shows that "electronic products" always account for the largest share of sales and the largest growth in the fourth quarter.

 6. Sales Channel Chart type: Throat chart explain: Funnel charts show the stages of the sales process, from the first contact to the final sale. Each segment of the circle represents a stage, and its width represents the number of customers and revenue in that segment. This chart helps identify where leads are falling, and where improvements can be made in the sales process. For example, there is a significant drop-off between the Application Delivery and Closeout periods, indicating the need for better tracking strategies.
